# DogsVsCatsNeuralNetwork
Convolutional Neural Network that distinguishes between dog and cat photos using Pytorch

Note to the data used in this neural network must be downloaded from the Microsoft store search up "dogs vs cats dataset microsoft" in browser

i recommend using a gpu and changing around the epochs

Also my final training and testing file is the "DogsVsCatsfinal" this also contains a graph of the accuracy and loss comparison and shows where the net started to diverge
